# Keyword Context Tracking with NLP

# Product Goal
As undergraduate students in computer science and engineering, we often find ourselves tediously scanning scholary articles. To sreamline this process, we decided to use Cohere's NLP API to help us find what we are searching for.

# Product Overview
In order to search through the document, the user enters keywords related to a topic/concept/event/etc. Instead of individually using CRTL+F to find instances of these words, the NLP model extracts meaning from the cluster of keywords and furthermore searches the document for the same meaning within the text. Using parsers, we are able to locate and return the page number to be refereneced. This process is done through a simple user interface that lets the user input the pdf file of the article and the keywords they are searching for. 


## Background information
At `Hack the North 2022` @Uwaterloo, Cohere AI, a sponsor of the event, challenged hackers to use their NLP API in hacks.
